Version:
I implemented this program using the MAC OS 10.15.7 operating system using
Java JDK version 16 with JOGL version 2.4

Issues:
The code compiles and runs correctly with objects moving according to their purpose in reality.
The UFO starts at the middle top of the screen and can be moved in any direction using the arrow keys.
There are several other objects including asteroids, spaceships, rockets, and fireballs that move in
directions based on reality while trying to hit the UFO.

Instructions:
The point of the game is to move the UFO to avoid the flying obstacles. If one of the obstacles, hits the UFO, the
game is over. The main point of the game is to hit the squirrel. When a collision is detected with the squirrell, a
You Win! will appear on the screen.

How to Run:
To run the program, extract the files from the zipped folder and place them inside a package in a Java program.
The JOGL library is needed for the program to run correctly. The code can be run by running the main function in
the DrawWindow class.
